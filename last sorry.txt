This is gonna be the last time I am gonna try to recover what we have between us.

I am not gonna make any excuses for the pain that I caused to both of us. its upto you trust my word or not.

I was going through a rough time in life when I asked you out. I shouldnt have. idk why but I got very anxious and impatient suddenly and spammed your dms and when I realised it would be hurting you I removed you, same case with carbon's account. I know it would have hurt you more by doing what I did.

when you said forget zeroo that hurt me a lot. how can I forget someone who did the following things:

she went to sleep after I went to sleep or closed discord in weekends. She was up all the time I was up when I was trying to fix my sleep schedule 
She got up and opened her laptop to help me in learning JavaScript 
I was the only one she told that she's quitting discord
she forgives me every single time
and I didn't forgive her one time she said something that hurt me
she helped me learn wuwa helped me farm 
she was talking to her friends but still made time to talk to me
she made spotify embed fixer just for me.

You know I never proposed to you because you always confuse me when you say things like youre asexual, you want to live with cats etc. It confuses me a lot But honestly I want a better job before getting a realtionship coz my current pay is shit af. And in March after I removed you it all clicked to me. You had proposed me via sharing Every second every day by Mina Okabe and I don't think you ever realised that I did reply back with Mesh by Ollie Lewin. 

I am gonna wait till your birthday probably and move on. 

Nobody ever is gonna come close to what you did. That expectation you set is way too high. 

Thank you for being the best pixel algorithm ever and sorry for all the times I hurt you. 

And honestly I don't ask for forgiveness I don't deserve it. I just wanted to lay this off my chest.
